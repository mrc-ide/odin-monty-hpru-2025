## odin - the beginnings (2016-2019)

-   **odin** created to integrate ODEs (e.g. for compartmental models) in R with a domain-specific language (DSL)
-   Limited support for difference (discrete-time) equations
-   Automatic translation to C/C++/JavaScript; efficient solutions in little code
-   Used in models of malaria, HIV, ebola and other diseases
-   No support for inference

## COVID-19 response

-   **mcstate** and **dust** emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic
-   Collaborative work by the UK real-time modelling & research software engineers teams at Imperial College
-   Tailored to handle and fit complex state-space models at scale (e.g. Knock et al. 2021)

## Challenges addressed by dust and mcstate

-   **Efficient** (marginal) likelihood computation for large stochastic models
-   Exploit parallelism (OpenMP) and particle filters
-   Limited toolkit for inference for models created in odin

## Recent developments

- Design of a new architecture, rewiring data, model and parameters
  - rewrite from ground up, keeping best ideas and discarding some baggage
- Design of a new interface

  - new small BUGS-inspired DSL for priors
  - modular approach to inference
  - inverts the dependency stack
- Development of automatic differentiation algorithms

## Key components

::::: columns

![](images/dependencies_odin_monty.png)
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

- Concept of "packer"
- monty models can be built from
    - odin and data
    - custom DSL
    - by composition
- MCMC samplers work on any monty model

## Introducing monty

-   **monty**: A framework to handle statistical models (defined by their domain and density)
-   Aims to offers multiple sampling solutions
-   Modular approach so that odin and monty "collaborate" but remain independent

## Introducing automatic differentiation {.smaller}

![](images/chained_graph.png)

- odin DSL is small
- Ladder shaped computation graph
- Regular parameter inputting (red)
- Regular state outputting (green)

## Reverse automatic differentiation {.smaller}

![](images/SSM_autodiff.png)

Goal: a large class of odin models and the DSL monty models can autodifferentiate

## The odin-monty vision

-   Provide a **modern modeling ecosystem**:
    1.  Powerful DSL (odin2+monty)
    2.  Streamlined parallel simulation & filtering engine (dust2)
    3.  User-friendly statistical integration platform (monty)
-   Empower researchers to build robust models quickly, accelerating scientific insights

# Toward the future

## odin2 and dust2 (Rich)

-\> @Rich for most people odin2 and dust2 are the same than odin and dust: can you summarise how the change make the whole toolkit more efficient? the parallelisation of parameter+stochastic draw groups is one I see and better memory usage between "fixed data" and changing parameters but feel free to put what you think

## 2025 Roadmap {.smaller}

- Finish development of automatic differentiation
- NUTS and HMC algorithms
- GPU acceleration via CUDA graph API
- MPI-based backend for many-node

Some missing features from mcstate/dust1
    -   multi-stage filters
    -   restarting filters
    -   GPU-accelerated fitting
    -   SMC\^2 and IF (perhaps)
-   Some almost-ready features
    -   Parallel tempering (exploit parallelism, cope with multiple modes)
    -   Automatic differentiation to be extended to almost all odin models


## Resources

-   We will provide a demonstration
-   You can find more in [our online odin-monty book](https://mrc-ide.github.io/odin-monty/)
